# Craftsman 20" Drill Press

## ⚠️ Safety

- Wear safety glasses and hearing protection.
- Do not wear gloves, jewelry, or long sleeves. Tie up long hair.
- Secure the workpiece to the table with a clamp or vise. Do not hold work by hand — the drill bit can catch and spin the workpiece violently.
- Never adjust the table, fence, or depth stop while the machine is running.
- Make sure the chuck key is removed before turning on the machine.
- Select the appropriate speed for the material and bit size. Lower speeds for larger bits and harder materials.
- Do not force the bit into the work. Let the bit do the cutting and apply steady, moderate pressure on the feed handle.
- If the bit binds or stalls, turn off the machine and clear the problem before restarting.

## Assembly Information

- Speed:
  - The drill press uses a belt and pulley system for speed changes. Unplug the machine and open the top cover to move the belt between pulleys.
  - Use lower speeds for large diameter bits and metal, higher speeds for small bits and wood.
- Table:
  - The table height is adjustable via the crank on the column. The table can also be swiveled out of the way for tall workpieces on the base.
  - Lock the table in position before drilling.
- Chuck:
  - The chuck accepts bits up to 5/8" shank diameter. Use the chuck key to tighten — hand-tight is not sufficient.
  - Tighten in all three positions on the chuck for a secure grip.
- Depth stop:
  - Use the depth stop for repeated holes at the same depth. Set it by lowering the quill to the desired depth and locking the stop nuts.

## Dust Collection

- Use a shop vac when drilling material that produces fine dust (MDF, plastics).
- Brush chips off the table after use. Do not blow chips with compressed air — they go everywhere.

## Usage Information

- Center punch your hole location before drilling. This prevents the bit from walking on the surface.
- Use a backing board (scrap plywood) under the workpiece to prevent tearout on the exit side and to protect the table.
- For metal, use cutting fluid and a slow speed. Clear chips frequently by raising the bit out of the hole periodically (peck drilling).
- For large holes in metal, drill a pilot hole first with a smaller bit.
- If drilling through-holes, ease up on pressure as the bit breaks through to avoid grabbing.
