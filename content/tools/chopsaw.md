# Bosch Sliding Compound Miter Saw

## ⚠️ Safety

- Wear safety glasses and hearing protection.
- Do not wear gloves, jewelry, or long sleeves. Tie up long hair.
- Keep your hands at least 6" from the blade at all times.
- Do not reach across the blade path for any reason while it is spinning.
- Allow the blade to reach full speed before beginning a cut.
- Let the blade come to a complete stop before raising it from the workpiece.
- Secure the workpiece firmly against the fence and table. Material that is not flush to the fence can kick or shift during the cut.
- Do not cut pieces too short to be safely held against the fence. If a piece is too small, use a clamp.
- Never cut freehand. The workpiece must always be supported by the fence.
- Do not cut round stock (dowels, pipe) without a proper fixture. Round material can spin and catch the blade.

## Assembly Information

- Miter:
  - The turntable rotates for angled crosscuts (miter cuts). There are positive stops at common angles (0°, 15°, 22.5°, 31.6°, 45°).
  - Loosen the miter lock handle to rotate the table, then tighten before cutting.
- Bevel:
  - The blade tilts for bevel cuts. Loosen the bevel lock to adjust, then tighten before cutting.
  - The saw can make compound cuts (miter + bevel simultaneously) for crown molding and similar work.
- Slide:
  - This is a sliding saw — the head pulls forward on rails to cut wider stock.
  - For sliding cuts, pull the head forward, lower into the work, and push back through the cut. Do not pull the saw toward you during the cut.
- Blade:
  - Unplug the machine before changing the blade.
  - Use the spindle lock and the included wrench to remove the arbor bolt. The bolt is reverse threaded.
  - If the blade is dull, write 'DULL' on it and post to Signal.

## Dust Collection

- Attach a shop vac or dust collector hose to the dust port on the back of the saw.
- The saw generates a lot of fine dust, especially in MDF and softwood. Always use dust collection.

## Usage Information

- Support long stock on both sides of the blade. Use roller stands or an outfeed support if the stock extends past the table.
- For repeat cuts at the same length, clamp a stop block to the fence or an extension table. Do not use the fence on the table saw as a length stop — this is a different machine.
- Make your layout marks on the face of the workpiece where you can see them, and align the blade to the waste side of the line.
- Clean up sawdust from the table and surrounding area when you are done. The dust builds up fast.
