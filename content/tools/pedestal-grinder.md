# 6" Pedestal Grinder

## ⚠️ Safety:

- Wear eye and hearing protection.
- Do not wear jewelry, gloves, or long sleeves. Tie up long hair.
- Adjust grinding rest to no more than ⅛” from the wheel. Smaller gap for smaller work.
- Do not adjust grinding rest when the wheel is in motion.
- Do not grind on the side of the wheel.
- Do not attempt to stop the wheel with your hands or any other object.

## Usage Information:

- There is a coarse wheel on the left and a fine wheel on the right. Use the coarse wheel whenever possible.
- Introduce the part to the wheel gently, and use the least pressure necessary.
- Dress the wheels frequently using the spur tool. Rest the lugs of the tool on the grinding rest and let the spinning spurs do the work. The wheel is normally dressed with a slight crown across the face and sharp corners.
- Adjust the grinding rest to provide the angle you require rather than working freehand whenever possible.
- Use water to cool the part frequently. For delicate heat treated parts, only grind for a second or two between dips.
