# Table Saw - Jet Hybrid

## ⚠️ Safety

- Use all guards applicable for the operation.
- Never stand directly in line with the saw blade or the part between the blade and the fence.
- Always control the stock between the blade and the fence.
- Never leave the table saw running unattended.
- Unplug the machine whenever making any adjustments to it.
- Always use the dust collector. Details below.

## Blade Change

- Unplug the saw
- remove the table insert and the riving knife if present.
- Loosen the arbor nut and remove the blade
- Blades are stored in the cubbies above the outfeed table. 
- If a blade is dull, write 'DULL' on it and post to Signal. 

## Dust Collection

Turn on the dust collector before using the saw. It is located behind the outfeed table. Do not use this dust collector for other purposes.

## Operations

### Ripping

Cutting a long piece of wood into narrower pieces. with solid wood, that's parallel to the grain, but proportions are more important than grain direction. If the part between the blade and the fence is wider than it is long, you are not ripping - see Crosscutting.

- Use the fence.
- Keep your hands at least 6" away from the blade.
- For rips narrower than 6", use a push stick to control the part between blade and fence.
- Provide horizontal pressure on the part against the fence in front of the blade (never behind it). This can be done with the left hand or with a push stick, depending on distance to the blade.
- For rips narrower than the push stick, let the narrow strip fall to the left of the blade, and the wide part pass between the fence and the blade. For repeat cuts, use a block to the left of the blade so that you can reset the fence each time, or use a thin-rip jig.
- Do not pick up a part behind the blade. Just push it away safely beyond the blade.

#### Sources of Danger
- The back of the blade is squeezed between the two parts, causing it to lift and fly forward.
- The part between the blade and fence may be caught and ejected forward. 
- Your hands may contact the blade.
- Clothing, the pushstick, or some other item contacts the blade unexpectedly.

### Crosscutting

Cutting a piece of wood into shorter pieces. For solid wood, that's across the grain, but again, proportions matter more than grain.

- Use a miter gage or sled. 
- Keep your hands at least 6" away from the blade.
- When using the miter gage:
  - Do not use the fence.
  - If the fence is needed for setting the length, clamp a block of known (~1") thickness to the fence in front of the blade, and butt the piece up against the block. Once in the cut, the piece should be free of the fence and block and will not bind or kick back.
- When using a sled:
  - Do not allow cut off parts to accumulate on the sled. Remove them after every cut.

### Joinery cuts

Such as cutting tenons, dadoes, rabbets, etc.
