# Angle Grinder

Angle grinders are versatile tools that are also extremely dangerous. This grinder can take 4 1/2” diameter discs of different types and spins them at very high RPM. Discs you can use include abrasive cut-off wheels, flap discs (course sandpaper), and other more technical heads such as wood power carvers, wire wheels, and more..

## ⚠️ Safety:

- Wear safety glasses and hearing protection and a full face shield.
- Use a mask or respirator for breathing protection whenever grinding that creates metal or wood dust.
- Do not wear jewelry or clothing with ties or other loose dangly bits. Tie up long hair.
- Wear appropriate gloves - heavy leather for grinding metal or snug fitting gloves for other materials. Do not wear loose floppy gloves.
- Wear long sleeves when grinding metal to protect against sparks or other flying debris.
- When starting the grinder, hold it firmly with both hands to compensate for the rotational forces.
- Never swing the grinder while it is on and always be aware of your surroundings and limbs when using it.
- Never lay the grinder down on the disc. The back of the grinder has flats for this purpose.

## Assembly Information:

- Trigger:
  - The trigger is on or off. When the trigger is fully depressed, the little button next to it can be pressed to keep the trigger in the “on” position.
- Speed Dial:
  - There is a dial at the bottom of the grinder that will speed up or slow down the RPMs. When in doubt, use a slower speed.
- Head:
  - Attach different tool heads and wheels using the wrench in the case. There is a button at the head that will lock the spindle in place.

## Usage Information:

- Ensure that the disc or tool head you have is properly secured.
- Plug-in the grinder.
- When using an abrasive cut-off disc, score the line of the cut you want to make lightly first. Make gradually deeper light passes. Repeated shallow cuts will provide better results.
- Never place pressure on the flat sides or transverse to the edge of an abrasive cut-off wheel. It can shatter and send debris at high velocity. Use a flap disc or wire brush wheel instead.
- When using a wire-wheel, ensure that you and anyone nearby has eye, face, and skin protection. The wires tend to fly off the wheel and embed themselves in anything soft nearby. You may not even notice that you have a wires in your arm, so be careful and use low RPMs.
