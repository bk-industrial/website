# Wood Lathe

## ⚠️ Safety

- Wear a full face shield. Safety glasses alone are not sufficient — wood lathes throw chips and occasionally larger pieces.
- Do not wear gloves, jewelry, or long sleeves. Tie up long hair. Anything loose near a spinning workpiece can pull you in.
- Inspect stock for cracks, knots, and loose bark before mounting. Defective stock can fly apart at speed.
- Always start at the lowest speed when mounting a new or rough workpiece. Increase speed only after the piece is running smoothly and is roughly round.
- Check that the workpiece clears the tool rest by rotating it by hand before turning on the machine.
- Keep the tool rest as close to the workpiece as practical. A large gap between the rest and the work invites catches.
- Never leave the lathe running unattended.
- Stand to the side of the workpiece, not directly in front of it, when starting the lathe for the first time on a new piece.
- Remove the tool rest before sanding on the lathe. Fingers between spinning wood and a steel rest is a bad time.

## Assembly Information

- Mounting methods:
  - Between centers: Use the spur drive in the headstock and the live center in the tailstock. This is the standard method for spindle work (table legs, handles, etc.).
  - Faceplate: Screw the workpiece to the faceplate for bowl turning and other face work. Use appropriately sized screws and make sure they are well seated.
  - Chuck: If a scroll chuck is available, it grips tenons or recesses turned into the workpiece. Always verify the chuck is fully tightened before starting.
- Tool rest:
  - Position the tool rest parallel to the workpiece and as close as possible without contact.
  - Adjust the height so that the cutting edge of your tool meets the workpiece at or slightly above center.
  - Always lock the tool rest before turning on the machine.
- Speed:
  - Use lower speeds for larger diameter and rough stock. Use higher speeds for smaller diameters and finish cuts.
  - If the lathe vibrates, reduce speed. Vibration means the workpiece is out of balance.

## Usage Information

- Lathe tools should be sharp. Dull tools cause catches and rough surfaces. If the shop's tools are dull, post to Signal.
- For spindle turning (between centers), use a roughing gouge to bring the piece round, then switch to a spindle gouge or skew for shaping and finishing.
- For bowl turning (faceplate), use a bowl gouge. Do not use a roughing gouge on a faceplate — the tang is not designed for the lateral forces in face work and can snap.
- Cut downhill — from large diameter to small diameter — whenever possible. Cutting uphill tears the grain.
- Take light cuts. Let the tool do the work rather than forcing it into the wood.
- Sand through the grits while the piece is still on the lathe. Hold sandpaper on the underside of the workpiece so it doesn't wrap around your fingers.
