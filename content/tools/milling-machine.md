# Grizzly 7x27 Milling Machine

7" x 27" table travel.

## ⚠️ Safety

- Wear safety glasses. A full face shield is recommended for heavy cuts.
- Do not wear gloves, jewelry, or long sleeves. Tie up long hair.
- Secure the workpiece firmly to the table with a vise, clamps, or fixture. An unsecured workpiece can be grabbed by the cutter and thrown.
- Remove the drawbar wrench and any other tools from the machine before starting the spindle.
- Never reach near the spinning cutter.
- Do not attempt to measure the workpiece while the spindle is running. Stop the machine first.
- Know where the emergency stop is before you start the machine.
- Chips are sharp. Do not brush them away by hand — use a chip brush when the machine is stopped.
- Be aware of the table travel limits. Crashing the table into the column or running out of travel during a cut can damage the machine or workpiece.

## Assembly Information

- Spindle and tooling:
  - The mill uses R8 collets. Match the collet to the shank size of the end mill or drill bit.
  - Insert the collet into the spindle, place the tool in the collet, and tighten the drawbar from the top of the head. Snug is sufficient — do not use a cheater bar.
  - To remove tooling, loosen the drawbar and give it a sharp tap with a soft mallet to break the collet free.
- Vise:
  - The milling vise should be aligned to the table travel. If it has been moved, indicate it in with a dial indicator before precision work.
  - Use parallels to raise the workpiece above the vise jaws so the cutter doesn't contact the vise.
- Speed:
  - Use lower RPM for larger cutters and harder materials. Use higher RPM for small cutters and soft materials.
  - If the machine bogs down or chatters, reduce the depth of cut or feed rate before increasing speed.

## Usage Information

- Plan your workholding and order of operations before turning on the machine. Think about how you will reach all the features you need to cut, and whether the tool or vise will collide with anything.
- Zero your axes to a known reference point on the workpiece before cutting. Use an edge finder for precise work, or touch off the tool to the workpiece for roughing.
- Take light cuts. This is a benchtop mill — heavy cuts will deflect the tooling and produce inaccurate work. Multiple light passes are better than one heavy pass.
- Use cutting fluid for steel and aluminum. Brass can be cut dry.
- Climb milling (cutter rotation and feed in the same direction) is generally not recommended on this machine, as the table leadscrews have enough backlash to pull the workpiece into the cutter. Use conventional milling (cutter rotation opposes feed direction).
- Lock any axis you are not actively moving during a cut. This prevents unwanted movement and improves surface finish.
- Clean chips off the table and ways after use. Wipe the table and bare metal surfaces with a light film of way oil to prevent rust.
