# Air Cleaners

## WEN 10x17 Air Cleaners

These air cleaners are set up to take dirty air from the shop, clean it, and push it into the clean area. This produces positive pressure in the clean area, which should keep the dust better contained in the shop. They should be on whenever the strip curtain is closed and people are using the shop. They are connected to the shop lighting circuit and their control panel has been bypassed in a reversible manner, so that it is always in high mode if it's plugged in.

### Ownership
- One with suspension hooks is owned by David Wilson
- One angle brackets owned by Josef Taylor

## JET/PSI 12x24 Air Cleaners

There is a PSI AC620 and a JET air cleaner hung over the tablesaw. Both of these should be running if the shop is in use. the JET has a remote control panel which has been bypassed in a reversible manner so that it is always in high mode if it's plugged in. The PSI has a pull-chain which should always be turned on.

They are equipped with re-usable primary filters. These should be vacuumed off whenever there is visible dust on them, and washed when replacing the inner filters.
