# Metal Lathe

6x18 — 6" swing over bed, 18" between centers.

## ⚠️ Safety

- Wear safety glasses. A full face shield is recommended for aggressive cuts.
- **Do not wear gloves** while operating the lathe. Gloves can catch on the chuck or workpiece and pull your hand in. This is the single most dangerous thing you can do on a lathe.
- Do not wear jewelry, long sleeves, or loose clothing. Tie up long hair.
- Remove the chuck key immediately after use. A chuck key left in a spinning chuck becomes a projectile.
- Never reach over or near the spinning workpiece or chuck.
- Do not attempt to measure the workpiece while it is spinning. Stop the lathe first.
- Do not attempt to stop the chuck by hand.
- Know where the emergency stop is before you start the machine.
- Chips are sharp and hot. Do not brush them away by hand — use a brush or chip hook when the machine is stopped.

## Assembly Information

- Chuck:
  - The lathe uses a 3-jaw self-centering chuck for most work. Tighten using the chuck key and remove the key before starting.
  - For irregularly shaped or precision work, use the 4-jaw independent chuck if available.
- Tool post:
  - Set the cutting tool at center height. Use shims under the tool if needed. A tool set above or below center will rub rather than cut.
  - Tighten the tool post securely. A loose tool can shift during a cut.
- Tailstock:
  - Lock the tailstock to the bed when using it for support or drilling.
  - Use a live center in the tailstock for turning between centers. A dead center generates heat and can seize.

## Usage Information

- Use cutting fluid for steel and aluminum. Brass and cast iron can be cut dry.
- Take light cuts. This is a small machine — heavy cuts will stall the motor or deflect the workpiece.
- For facing (cutting the end of the workpiece flat), feed from the outside toward the center.
- For turning (reducing diameter), set the depth of cut with the cross slide and feed along the work with the carriage.
- Clear chips frequently. Long stringy chips can wrap around the workpiece and create a hazard — if you're getting long chips, adjust your feed rate or depth of cut.
- Check your dimensions frequently with calipers. It's easy to take off too much material.
- When threading, practice the engagement and disengagement of the half-nut at low speed before cutting. Threading at speed without confidence in the controls is a good way to crash the tool into the chuck.
