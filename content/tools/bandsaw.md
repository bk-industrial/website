# Bandsaw

## Delta 14"

- The saw is equipped with a mobile base. Use the foot paddles to lower the casters to move it, and make sure it is immobilized before use.
- This saw is configured for cutting soft materials such as wood and plastic.
- The saw takes a 93 ½” blade, and is equipped with one of three blades:
  - [3/4" x 2/3VPC](https://www.pswood.com/3-4-x-2-3vpc-series-timber-wolf-band-saw-blades/) rip blade for straight cuts in thick materials (>3”)
  - [1/2" x 3/4VPC](https://www.pswood.com/1-2-x-3-4vpc-series-timber-wolf-band-saw-blades/) general purpose blade for material down to 1” thick
  - [1/4" x 8RK](https://www.pswood.com/1-4-x-8rk-series-timber-wolf-band-saw-blade/) turning blade for thin materials and for curves down to ⅝” radius

## Grizzly 14" with riser block

- The saw is equipped with a mobile base. Use the foot paddles to lower the casters to move it, and make sure it is immobilized before use.
- This saw is configured for cutting soft materials such as wood and plastic.
- The saw takes a _longer_ blade TODO: what blades do we have.

## ⚠️ Safety

- Wear safety glasses and hearing protection.
- Do not wear jewelry or long sleeves. Tie up long hair.
- Make sure that the cut is supported by the table. If the part being cut is cantilevered off in space, it can tilt and catch the blade
- Use the table insert whenever possible. (It must be removed in order to tilt the table)
- Lower the upper guide to within a 1/2" of the work.
- Keep your pushing hands away from the line of the cut - it's easy to push hard on this saw, especially when resawing. If you're pushing hard and the blade finds soft material, it's going to drastically change the feed rate and the blade may exit the work before you expected it to.

## Assembly Information

### Changing the blade
  1.  Unplug the saw.
  2.  Remove upper and lower wheel guards, and dust collection.
  3.  Remove the table peg and insert.
  4.  De-tension the upper wheel using the handwheel on the frame.
  5.  Remove the blade. Blades are stored in the cubbies above the jointer. Use caution in rolling up or un-furling a blade, as they can move quickly and are sharp! 
  6.  If a blade is broken or dull, post to #General in Slack.
  7.  Back off the thrust bearings at top and bottom blade guides
  8.  Install the new blade on the wheels, and tension to the mark corresponding to the width of the blade.
  9.  Check the blade guide blocks; make sure they are not in contact with the blade. If they make contact, back them out until they are well clear. If they are worn, post to #general.
  10. Spin the upper wheel by hand, paying attention to the tracking. Use the tracking adjustment (near the top wheel tension) to position the blade in the middle of the wheel.
  11. Reinstall the upper and lower wheel guards (skip the other parts for now) and plug in the saw.
  12. With the saw running, de-tension the upper wheel until the blade just starts to flutter, then tension until it stops.
  13. Advance the thrust bearings until they contact the blade and spin, dial them back until they do not make contact. Turn off the saw.
  14. If the blade guide blocks need adjustment, unplug the saw again. Set the blocks so that a business card (a cheap one, not one of those fancy thicc bois) can be slipped into the space on each side without moving the blade.
  15. Install the table insert, dust collection, and table peg.

### Adjusting the fence:
  1.  To be documented

### Adjusting the table:
  1.  Remove the table insert.
  2.  Loosen the hand screws in front and behind the blade which clamp the table to the trunnions.
  3.  The table can be set between 0 and 45 degrees to the horizontal. There is an adjustable stop at 0.
  4.  Move the table to the desired angle, and tighten the hand screws.

## Dust Collection

- Attach a 4" vacuum hose to the Y-splitter below the Delta saw, or to the 4" port in the casting of the Grizzly.

## Usage Information

- Use the proper blade for the operation.
- When sawing aluminum, make sure there are at least two teeth in the material; i.e. for ½” aluminum plate, use a blade with at least 4 TPI. More teeth, more better the cut.
- Don’t trust the saw to cut parallel to the fence unless you set it up to do so (following the instructions above usually does the trick). If you’re making a quick cut and don’t want to go through the setup, just cut to a line rather than using the fence.
