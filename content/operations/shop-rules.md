# Shop Rules

For the purposes of this document, the shop is the common space by the window, separated by the meat locker curtains.

## Tool Use

Power tools in the shop are available for any authorized person to use. 
Do not leave your own tools in the workshop if you would be mad if someone else used them.
Do not modify, reconfigure, or repair tools, jigs, or fixtures that do not belong to you. 
Tools are not common property of the shop, but personal property of one or more members. 

Tools are classified into three tiers:
- Tier 1: Tools which are relatively safe and don't require specific training. All members and supervised guests are authorized to use these tools.
- Tier 2: Tools which pose some danger, but whose safe usage is simple. Members must read the safety documentation before use.
- Tier 3: Tools which pose some danger to the user, or can cause expensive damage, or whose safe usage is complicated. Members must receive training before use.

## Tool Maintenance

Please report issues with tools to the Shop Manager and the tool owner as soon as possible. 
If there is a safety concern, lock out the tool (unplug and tape a sign over the power switch).

- If you break a tool by misuse, please immediately replace the part or tool at your own cost. Contact the shop manager if it is not clear where to get the part, or if cost is prohibitive.
- If a consumable wears out, please contact the shop manager, who will replace the consumable from the shop budget (split costs among the group)
- If a part breaks or wears out due to the tool owner's failure to maintain their tool, (especially if the shop manager has previously asked to fix the tool), the tool owner is responsible for replacing the part, or removing the tool from the shop.

The shop manager is responsible for monitoring the consumables and condition of tools in the shop, and will replace consumables at their discretion from the shop budget (pursuant to the rules in the operating agreement). If problems are found with a tool, the shop manager will ask the tool owner before taking repair actions, and may lock out the tool until it has been repaired. 

### Clamps
Clamps must be returned to the clamp rack after use.
Rack clamps fully extended; like with like, short clamps in front of long clamps. 

## Dust Collection

All stationary tools must be used with appropriate dust collection.
Check frequently for jams, blockages, and full bags.
Use dust collection on handheld power tools whenever possible

## Projects Left in the Shop

Users should take care to leave the shop in a clean and orderly state. 
If you must leave a project in the shop, communicate this via appropriate channels so that others can continue to use the shop, and so that if others need to move your project, they can do so safely. 

The appropriate channels are as follows:
- Post to Signal for immediate and temporary conditions, such as a glue-up or paint job. Tell us when it will be safe to move, even if you'll be in to move it soon.
- Create a calendar event for ongoing occupations. If you've got a rush job and need to destroy the shop for a weekend, other people can see the event and coordinate with you.

Projects left in the shop should be treated with care and respect. 
Before moving a project, check the channels above for instructions or contact the owner.

## Trash and Scrap

We don't want to become timber hoarders, but we are frugal people who abhor waste. 
Feel free to make use of anything in the scrap bin or drum, and anything in the vertical stock storage if it is not labelled 
(though if it's nice, or if you think you know whose it is, ask before you cut it up.)

We maintain the following waste streams:

### Clean Wood Scrap

- Place all small, clean wood scrap in the left bin under the tablesaw
- Wood scraps which are longer than the bin should be cut into smaller pieces, or if they are of value, placed in the vertical stock storage.

Each month, the bin and drum will be sorted for better quality scraps. 
Those which do not make the cut will be sent to a farm upstate where they can run free (in a fire).

### Composite Scraps

Composites include plywood, MDF, plastic, etc.; 
anything you wouldn't burn or recycle.

- Place all small, clean composite scrap in the right bin under the table saw. 
- Longer scraps go in the 55 gallon drum.
- Composite scraps which are longer than the drum should be cut into smaller pieces, or if they are of value, placed in the vertical stock storage.

Each month, the bin and drum will be sorted for better quality scraps. 
Those which do not make the cut will be sent to the landfill.

### Garbage

Garbage should be placed in black or brown garbage cans, located in the shop or kitchen.
Food waste should be placed in the red ~~fireproof~~ mouseproof cans.

Please take out garbage whenever it is full.

### Cardboard Recycling

All cardboard must be flattened and placed under the kitchen table. Paper, unfortunately, must go in the garbage.

### Aluminum Recycling

Aluminum cans go in the blue bin in the kitchen. When full, Gabe takes these home and leaves them for the can collectors.

## Wood Finishes, Paint, Glue, Etc

### Storage

- Products marked 'FLAMMABLE' should be stored in the yellow flammables cabinet
- Products marked 'COMBUSTIBLE' may be stored in the red general storage cabinet.
- Wood finishes should not be left in the shop when not in use.
- We stock titebond PVA glue in three classic flavors; please dont buy your own unless you have a huge project, as it has a shelf life. Working bottles are in the shop, refills in the red cabinet.

### ⚠️ Safety

- Some finishes, e.g. polyurethane, will generate harmful fumes.
  - Make sure the area is properly ventilated.
  - Make sure no other shop member needs the area before the fumes are gone.
- Be careful with oily rags.
  - Drying oils (linseed oil, tung oil, etc) generate heat when they cure. A crumpled up rag soaked in a drying oil can self combust.
  - Don’t burn the shop down!
  - Let oily rags dry on the designated metal tray, and make sure they’re laid out flat. When they’re 110% dry, toss them in the garbage.
  - If you’re in doubt about how to handle this, ask for help.
