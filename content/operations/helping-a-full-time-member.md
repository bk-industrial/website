## Helping a Full-Time Shop Member

Occassionally, full-time shop members may need assistance on larger projects that span multiple sessions or weeks.

These are the expectations, responsibilities, and practical rules for people who are assisting a full-time shop member over an extended period (multiple sessions or weeks). Please follow these guidelines to keep the shop safe, efficient, and respectful for everyone.

Helpers have similar responsibilities and privileges to flex members - they may work on their own projects, have access to the shop, etc. as long as they are engaged by a full-time member who takes responsibility for them.

Full time members should ensure their helpers are familiar with and follow all shop and community rules. They are your responsibility while in the shop. They should be covered under your insurace and if they damage anything, **you are responsible for it.**

### Checklist for full-time members bringing in helpers

- [ ] Have them read this page and the following:
    - [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct)
    - [Shop Rules](/operations/shop-rules)
    - [Leaving The shop](/operations/leaving-the-shop)
- [ ] Review and discuss the above rules with the helper and reinforce their importance.
- [ ] Add them to our shared chat and tell them to ask questions and communicate there.
- [ ] Ensure they are trained on and can safely use any tools they will be using.

TL;DR They are expected to follow all shop rules and clean up just as you are. We are a community space, each tool is owned by someone, and we all share responsibility for keeping the shop safe and functional. When in doubt, communicate it in the shared chat.
