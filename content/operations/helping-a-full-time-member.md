## Helping a Full-Time Shop Member

Occassionally, full-time shop members may need assistance on larger projects that span multiple sessions or weeks.

This page explains expectations, responsibilities, and practical rules for people who are assisting a full-time shop member on a project that will take place over an extended period (multiple sessions or weeks). Please follow these guidelines to keep the shop safe, efficient, and respectful for everyone.

Full time members should ensure anyone helping them is familiar with and follows the community and shop guidelines. They are your responsibility while in the shop. They should be covered under your insurace and if they damage anything, **you are responsible for it.**

### Checklist for full-time members bringing in helpers

- [ ] Have them read this page and the following:
    - [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct)
    - [Shop Rules](/operations/shop-rules)
    - [Leaving The shop](/operations/leaving-the-shop)
- [ ]: Review shop rules and leaving the shop procedures with them.
- [ ]: Add them to our shared chat and tell them to ask questions and communicate there.
- [ ]: Ensure they know how to use any tools they will be using. 

TL:DR They are expected to follow all shop rules and clean up just as you are. We are a community space, each tool is owned by someone, and we all share responsibility for keeping the shop safe and functional. When in doubt, communicate it in the shared chat.
