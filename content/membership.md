# Membership

**Become a member at Brooklyn Industrial Arts!**

Brooklyn Industrial Arts is a shop, collective, and a place for people to make physical projects come to life. We do share resources and spend a lot of time observing and helping out with each othersâ€™ projects, but the shop itself is set up such that each Member has their own dedicated workbench/desk.

Interested? [Let us know how you want to use the shop!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuNXVlvfGhaNH_uV8uBMtWSCDZVuUFS4AMfYnVAnCtPwQzGQ/viewform) or [send us an email](mailto:info@bkindustrial.art) to schedule a tour or learn more.

Full membership is a percentage of the operating costs given the number of people in the shop at the time. Currently, this works out to ~700-$800/mo. We share the cost of the commercial lease for the space which is currently about $5500/mo. Member includes access to the space and storage for tools and supplies, enabling long-term projects to develop freely.


All memberships come with 24/7 building access.
