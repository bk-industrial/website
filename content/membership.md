# Membership

**Become a member at Brooklyn Industrial Arts!**

Brooklyn Industrial Arts is a shop, collective, and a place for people to make physical projects come to life. We do share resources and spend a lot of time observing and helping out with each others’ projects, but the shop itself is set up such that each Member has their own dedicated workbench/desk.

Interested? [Let us know how you want to use the shop!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuNXVlvfGhaNH_uV8uBMtWSCDZVuUFS4AMfYnVAnCtPwQzGQ/viewform) or [send us an email](mailto:info@bkindustrial.art) to schedule a tour or learn more.

Full membership is a percentage of the operating costs given the number of people in the shop at the time. Currently, this works out to ~700-$800/mo. We share the cost of the commercial lease for the space which is currently about $5500/mo. Member includes access to the space and storage for tools and supplies, enabling long-term projects to develop freely.

Brooklyn Industrial Arts will hold general liability insurance for the shared common area and for the lease. We ask all members to hold their own general liability insurance naming Brooklyn Industrial Arts as an additionally insured party.

It can be hard to find the right insurance for what you plan to work on at Brooklyn Industrial Arts. We've prepared a helpful guide with a few insurers members have worked with before. [Check it out here](/insurance).
