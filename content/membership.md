# Membership

**Become a member at BKIC!**

BKIC is a shop, collective, and a place for people to make physical projects come to life. We do share resources and spend a lot of time observing and helping out with each others’ projects, but the shop itself is set up such that each Member has their own dedicated workbench/desk.

### BKIC Membership Options

| Full Voting Membership | Bring your own workbench + common tables | 24/7  access + space for large project work | Split % of Rent and Shop fees |

Full membership is a percentage of the operating costs given the number of people in the shop at the time. Currently, this works out to ~700-$800/mo. We share the cost of the commercial lease for the space which is currently about $5500/mo. Member includes access to the space and storage for tools and supplies, enabling long-term projects to develop freely.


All memberships come with 24/7 building access.
