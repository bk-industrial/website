# Membership

**Become a member at BKIC!**

BKIC is a shop, collective, and a place for people to make physical projects come to life. We do share resources and spend a lot of time observing and helping out with each others’ projects, but the shop itself is set up such that each Member has their own dedicated workbench/desk.

Interested? [Let us know how you want to use the shop!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuNXVlvfGhaNH_uV8uBMtWSCDZVuUFS4AMfYnVAnCtPwQzGQ/viewform)

### BKIC Membership Options

BKIC offers 2 membership options at the moment:

| Type                   |                Workspace                 |                   Access                    |             Price             |
| ---------------------- | :--------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------: | :---------------------------: |
| Full Voting Membership | Bring your own workbench + common tables | 24/7  access + space for large project work | Split % of Rent and Shop fees |
| Full access to tools | common tables and space | 24/7  access | $299/month |

---

Full membership is a percentage of the operating costs given the number of people in the shop at the time. Currently, this works out to ~700-$800/mo. We share the cost of the commercial lease for the space which is currently about $5500/mo. Member includes access to the space and storage for tools and supplies, enabling long-term projects to develop freely.


All memberships come with 24/7 building access.
