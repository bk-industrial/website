If you're working on physical projects in NYC, you know how hard it is to find an affordable, convenient workshop. Brooklyn Industrial Arts is organized to be flexible, offering just the right amenities for you to build your business and sustain hobby time in a friendly, supportive environment.

Brooklyn Industrial Arts is a community of makers, designers, and engineers who share tools, knowledge, and space. You might call us a makerspace. We offer a range of membership options, from full-time to part-time to storage-only, to suit your needs. Our shop is equipped with a range of member owned tools, including a CNC router, laser cutter, 3D printers, and more. We also have a range of hand tools and workbenches, as well as a kitchen and lounge area.

Brooklyn Industrial Arts also hosts a range of in-person events, including hardware happy hours, community laser nights, and periodic shop hangs.

We're located in north Brooklyn at 544 Park Ave, Suite 332, Brooklyn NY 11205.
