# Shop Information


Brooklyn Industrial Arts members get access inventory storage, and easy shipping & receiving of palletized goods, and communal workspace. Brooklyn Industrial Arts is located in the heart of North Brooklynâ€™s product distribution district, making it an ideal place to build and ship your product, sculpture, or other project.

Brooklyn Industrial Arts allows members to bring their own workbench and tools. Members may share their tools as projects require from one another. We are a community of makers, designers, and engineers who share tools, knowledge, and space. Our shop is equipped with a range of member owned tools.
